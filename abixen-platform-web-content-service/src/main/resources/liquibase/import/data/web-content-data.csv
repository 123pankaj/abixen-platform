With loosely coupled components, it opens up a possibility of a efficient division of work between development teams and for a simple and inexpensive system maintenance. Creating a new module, a new functionality, a developer must not interfere with the existing source code. He can create a new microservice, being a separate spring boot application. Then, implementing necessary interfaces achieves opportunity to integrate the newly created microservice with Abixen Platform structure.</h3><h3>Finally, a business administrator may use it over the platform. <span style="color:#008000;"><em><span style="background-color:#FFFFE0;">Abixen Platform supplies out of the box a few functional modules closed in the Business Intelligence Service and in the Web Content Service.</span> </em></span></h3><h3>This is a good example, how to create the own microservice. Mentioned services provide mainly visualisation functionalities, such as charts, micro charts, KPIs. As well as a web content management, such as templates, structures, articles. However opportunities to develop data entry modules are still opened!&nbsp</h3>;1;2017-05-03 00:00:00;1;2017-05-03 00:00:00
